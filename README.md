# simple rsa implementation

Simple RSA implementation. Using two large primes, generates public and private RSA keys. Prompts user for a message, encodes that message, encrypts it using the public key, and decrypts it using the private key.

Implementation is purely for learning purposes. RSA is a pretty wild process that underpins almost all secure, digital communicaitons. At it's core, it's also surprisingly simple.
